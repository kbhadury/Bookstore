# Bookstore

### Overview
I spent one year in college working in a small IT department on campus.  I had an amazing manager, and he gave me a bunch of side projects to work on.  It started with setting up a web server, and then he had me connect it to a database.  I used [this website]("https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Tomcat_HowTo.html") to teach myself, and in their example they create a mock bookstore.  My manager ran with the idea and asked me to add user accounts and a shopping cart feature, and by the end of it all I had my own basic shopping website.

This repository holds all the code that went into it.  The web server and database require certain configuration details which I haven't included, since this code isn't really meant to be copied and run - I mainly created this repo as a souvenir from my time in the IT department.  Feel free to browse around!

### Specifications
Operating system: CentOS 7 (via VirtualBox)

Web server: Apache Tomcat 8

I had a lot of fun with this project and learned a ton.  Special thanks to everyone at the office who helped me along the way.
